## Description

In this application I created a Node.js command-line application that can be used to create a HTML website that displays the basic information of every employee that was entered by the user. The application was built without significant starter code and assumes that the first team member of the work team will be a manager. From there the user will be prompted until all the members of the team has been added.

This application also includes testing parameters for each employee and will ensure proper information is being inputted into the respective fields.

See Deployed Application: [Workout Tracker](https://gentle-sea-38975.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

To get started:

- no installation is required to use this browser based application.

## Usage

To add a note, the user must enter both a title and a message for the note then click the save icon. The user will be able to see a list of all notes on the left hand column and will be able to close inspect upon selecting the note. The user will also be able to delete notes individually by clicking the trash can icon.

The user will also be able to see the JSON script of all notes be using the /api/notes extension on the URL browser.
