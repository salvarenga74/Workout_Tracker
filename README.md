## Description

In this application I used starter code to create a Workout Tracker by creating a **Mongo** database with a **Mongoose** schema and handle routes with **Express**. This application also uses the MongoDB aggregate function to dynamically add up and return the total duration for each workout.

The Workout Tracker is a deployed application in which the user can view, create, and track different exercises through out their daily workouts. In addition to being able to create, update, and display from the Mongo database, this application uses a MongoDB Atlas connection to create the global deployment.

See Deployed Application: [Workout Tracker](https://desolate-chamber-19294.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

To get started:

- no installation is required to use this browser based application.

## Usage

From the Homepage a user will be able to click on the Dashboard to view their stats represented as a line graph of the cumulative duration of all exercises performed each day. Along side the line graph, the user sees a bar graph with the cumulative weight amount of all exercises performed each day for the 7 workouts. Click the Fitness Tracker button to go back to the Homepage at any time.

In the center of the Homepage a user will be able to see the information for the previous exercise entered. The user will also be able to create a new workout or add a new exercise to the current day's workout.

NOTE: after adding or updating a workout, the user must press the complete button to go back to the Homepage without duplication of the exercise. Also only resistance exercises will be taken into account for the Total Weight Bar graph, but all exercise durations will appear in the line graph.
